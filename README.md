## Description <a id="description"></a>

This landing page was created as my solution to the second challenge task of a
web development bootcamp. For this task, very basic starter code was presented
as an initial outline for the task, although I did not use this code. My task
was as follows:

1. Create a portfolio page combining (at a minimum) flexbox, CSS variables and
   media queries
2. Include my name, a recent photograph and sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
3. Include a navigation bar with links and a UI that scrolls to the corresponding section
4. Populate the section about my work with titled images of my applications
5. Ensure that the first application image is larger in size than the others
6. Ensure that when images of the applications are clicked, the user is taken to
   that deployed application
7. Ensure that when the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices
   then the layout is responsive and adapts to the viewport

The appearance of the page is as follows:
